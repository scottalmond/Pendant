xx make area of silk screen for handwritten iteration number
xx tie D+ and D- together to charge? NOT NEEDED
xx need to nudge down passives near usb header away from 1.4" edge
xx desire to nude up audio passives
xxremove routing under progamming header
xx re-route button: wires are crossed currently, causing a short
xx desire to nudge button north, DOESN"T APPEAR TO BE NEEDED

0.263+0.27


-- v2.1 to NEXT Rev changes --
power switch:
reduce internal power switch hole width 20%...
reduce power switch height by 50 mil to make sliding easier
reduce length of user interface by 20 mil
set power switch width: WAS 8 mil, IS 7 mil
  depth looks about good as-is, particualr if width is being reduced

front case
widen board, WAS 2.024, IS 2.032 (1.016 radius)
  need: 2.000 --> 2.008
slide pcb down... 24 mil, WAS 0.678, IS 0.702 relative to origin
  height IS now 1.542
increase battery witdh by 16 mil, WAS 1.44, IS 1.456

TODO
fix registration on rear plate
add dimple to button interface
add circle locator for button input
trough/hole for hot glue

2.1 mm from center to tip of button, 0.2 mm depression --> 0.083 in
center at 4.2, 4.04
0.0566 from edge of board to center of button
button overhangs 0.083-0.0566 = 0.026 in
  add 12 mil margin --> 0.038
dimple thickness = 0.479-0.27 = 0.209 of all
  0.209 - 0.063 pcb = 0.146, but give 6 mil margin to PCB: 0.140
restraint sizing:
  100 mil from lip *2; 400 mil wide restraint 40 mil clearance on each side

--

WAS case v2.3, IS case 2.4
WAS rear v1.2, IS rear 1.3
case: added 30 mil to length to fill in restraint gap WAS 0.4, IS 0.43
added 50 mil height to restraint to compensate for rear thickness on back cover
pulled inner restraint wall 10 mil away from center
moved rear restraint harness south towrads battery holder by 20 mil, making rear case move up and have less lip over battery holder
button dimple: 26 mil overhang, plus 20 margin = 46 mil from board
added 20 mil chamfer to bottom of dimple to help with fabrication of an overhang

todo: lengthen power button rail --> see if its an issue with populated hardware

--

re-add v1.4
fixed the retraint harness that was forgotten/omitted in v1.3

--

case v2.4 -> 2.5
added 20 mil to jst header north side (82 mil to 84 mil)
extend restrain 20 mil in length, is 0.450"
move button dimple closer to pcb by 16 mil: was 1.358, is 1.342


extend button contact dimple

--

IS front v2.6
extended southern jst notch by 10 mil (was 44 mil, is 54 mil)
rear v1.6: extended button dimpler 6 mil: was 1.342, is 1.336
move retraint landing pad 10 mil: was 40 mil, is 50 mil from outer plane
took 10 mil off outer diameter of lower half of rear face

--

IS front v2.7
rear 1.7
add 20 mil to restraint thickness
added retangular cut out of swoosh to front face to let more light (of properly mixed color) through to front surface - was having issues with 3d print edges interfereing with colors (LED 8)
added 20 mil chamer to logo outline


--

rear v1.8
add 12 mil bo button nub
was 1.336, is 1.324

--

need to enlarge paper laser cut
may consider shrinking or reworking 3d print face to limit swoosh light emissions
