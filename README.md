# Pendant

The purpose of this project is to develop a piece of artisan eletronics to serve as a prize for an eletronics competition.  The design consists of a PCB and 3D-printed case.  The CAD model for the case has been excluded from this project because it incorporates proprietary elements.

Development Tools
Arduino IDE
KiCAD
FreeCAD

The J3 header has a 1:1 pinout matching the Attiny85 processor.
Instructions for programming the Attiny85 using an Arduino is documented at the start of the Arduino code.  Once the Arduino has been programmed with the ArduinoAsISP program, it can be connected to the J3 programming header using the following connections:
